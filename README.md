# Spark Ease

Spark Ease is the back-office interface for the Spark platform. It is built using Next.js 13, a powerful React framework that enables features such as server-side rendering and static site generation.

## Features

- **Server Side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js is known for its server-side rendering capabilities, which can improve the performance and SEO of your application.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: If parts of your application do not require dynamic data, you can use static site generation to further improve performance.
- **API Routes**: Next.js offers the ability to create API routes directly in your application, which can be useful for creating application-specific endpoints.
- **TypeScript Support**: If you prefer using TypeScript, Next.js offers built-in support, which can help prevent type errors and improve code quality.
- **Image Optimization**: Next.js offers automatic image optimization, which can improve the performance of your application.
